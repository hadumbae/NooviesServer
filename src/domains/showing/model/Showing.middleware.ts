/**
 * @fileoverview
 * Registers Mongoose middleware for the `Showing` model to automate
 * seat map management and cleanup.
 *
 * @description
 * This module attaches lifecycle hooks to the `ShowingSchema` to:
 *
 * - Generate seat maps when a new showing is created.
 * - Remove seat maps when a showing is deleted.
 * - Populate virtual counts when performing `find` queries with lean mode.
 *
 * ---
 * ### Hook Summary
 * | Hook Type | Stage | Responsibility |
 * |------------|--------|----------------|
 * | `pre("find")`, `pre("findOne")`, `pre("findOneAndUpdate")` | Query | Auto-populate virtual seat counts if lean virtuals are enabled. |
 * | `pre("save")` | Document | Mark document as newly created before saving. |
 * | `post("save")` | Document | Create a seat map if this is a newly inserted showing. |
 * | `post("deleteOne", {document:true})` | Document | Delete seat maps belonging to the removed showing. |
 * | `post("deleteOne" / "deleteMany", {query:true})` | Query | Remove seat maps belonging to showings deleted via query. |
