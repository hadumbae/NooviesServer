 * Service provider for the **MovieCredit domain**.

 * This class wires together all dependencies related to `MovieCredit`:
 * - **Model**: Mongoose schema and data access.
 * - **Repository**: Handles direct database operations.
 * - **Services**: Encapsulate domain logic, query parsing, and aggregation.
 * - **Controller**: Exposes endpoints for HTTP routing.
 *
 * Designed to be called during application startup to provide a
 * ready-to-use, self-contained package of MovieCredit components.

     *   - `aggregateService`: {@link AggregateQueryService} for aggregation pipelines.
